# RL-API
Reinforcment Learning (RL) techniques should be accessible to anyone with an interest in programming and Artificial
Intelligence. Unfortunately, the field is broad, with exponential growth in the number of research papers published
each year. This repository seeks to generalize these solutions to RL problem, by creating an API which can be used to 
build any type of agent using any desired framework, support research through clear, transparent, and extensible
implementation, and support fast prototyping of complex experimental systems by an easy to use API and library of
algorithms. 

## Platform
This project will be built under Python3.6, and will largely use TensorFlow and Keras for standard Machine Learning
tools. Many of the example agents will be based on OpenAI/gym environments with the goal of reproducing results for
each of the standard RL tasks available there. 

## Development Phase 1
This is just the beginning. Here are the main goals:

 - [ ] Project Description and Sprint Planning
 - [ ] Create API Usability Tests
 - [ ] Upfront Design of the API (Interface Only)
 
And so it Begins!
