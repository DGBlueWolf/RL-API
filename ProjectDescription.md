# Project Description
Math is hard, programming is hard, research is hard. It should be *EASY*. This project aims to alleviate such pain and 
suffering starting with the field of Reinforcement Learning. So let's design an *simple* and *consistent* API for fast 
prototyping of RL agents to solve general RL problems.  To work toward such an API (with it's corresponding library), 
we'll specify some initial goals.

- **Make it Fully-functional** For any environment, the user should be able to build an agent using this API that 
solves the problem. They should not need to rely on any other external library to develop a fully functional agent.

- **Make it Extensible** A researcher should be able to make changes to an algorithm with minimal effort and certainly 
not reimplementation of core code. These means algorithms must be broken down into their function components. There is
a risk that doing so might create unnecessary overhead and additional complexity for the end-user.

- **Make it Transparent** For any application, the researcher should be able to understand the implementation of every
tool provided in the library. To facilitate this, comments and README's should help provide links and answers to a set
of anticipated (crowd sourced) questions. Furthermore, Inter-dependencies between the provided tools should be kept to
a minimum.

- **Make it Fast** It should be possible to link components and agents together to create complex experimental
systems which could be used to solve a vast array of problems.

- **Give Credit Where Credit is Due** For any algorithm available through the API not written by the developer, 
there must be a summary of research, a clear description of the algorithm in pseudocode, a link to the original 
papers and repositories, and a clear reference to the original authors.

## To Build Something Beautiful
This open source project is not to meet the need of any business. The primary goal is to increase the productivity of
all developers in the field of Reinforcement Learning, and lower the barrier for entry into the field for the young
and up and coming developers. We'll do that by providing clear, instructive implementations, and provide links to 
resources for further guidance. That being said, we understand that this project might have significant value in the 
business world, and would like users to acknowledge that value as this project gets underway.

## That 120% Time
Starting a project like this requires significant personal investment, but the outcomes of success are well worth the
risk. It's worth 120% effort, on that extra 20% time outside of work and other activities and obligations. Ideally
this means the issues, and backlog for a given phase should account for 40 hours of work per Developer. As this is 
intended to be a side project, there is no weekly expectation for any Developer, rather time commitment should be 
driven by the interest to contribute to the project.

There is a potential risk that this project code compete with other projects, or duplicate work towards the same goal.
Therefore, Developers are encouraged for each entry in the backlog to search out implementations to the issue, 
understand the project goals associated with identified repositories, and make a decision as to whether to incorporate
the existing solution if possible or redesign it in the context of this project.

## Implementation
This project will be predominately written in Python3.6 using appropiate coding standards and adhering to the yet to be
specified guidelines.
